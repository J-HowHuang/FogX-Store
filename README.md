# ü¶ä üóÉÔ∏è FogX-Store 
FogX-Store is a dataset store service that collects and serves large robotics datasets. 

Users of [Fog-X](https://github.com/KeplerC/fog_x/tree/main), machine learning practitioners in robotics, can solely rely on FogX-Store to get datasets from different data source (FogX-Store is the Hub!), and perform analytic workloads without the need to manage the data flow themselves.

```
$ poetry shell
Spawning shell within /home/ubuntu/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/fogxstore-nGESZMNh-py3.10
. /home/ubuntu/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/fogxstore-nGESZMNh-py3.10/bin/activate
(fogxstore-py3.10)$ which python3
/home/ubuntu/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/fogxstore-nGESZMNh-py3.10/bin/python3
```

## Example

### Run a FogX-Store server

```
python3 examples/example_server.py
